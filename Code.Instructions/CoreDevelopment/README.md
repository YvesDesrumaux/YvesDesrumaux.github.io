- Code structure and organization principles
- Basic AL development best practices

## Included Guidelines

### al-development-guide.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive AL language guidance covering development standards and patterns
**When to use**: Starting new AL development, learning AL best practices, implementing standard development patterns
**Key topics**: AL syntax, object development, extension model, code organization

### coding-standards.md
**Purpose**: Code structure, formatting, and basic coding standards for AL development
**When to use**: Establishing code formatting standards, ensuring consistent code style, following development conventions
**Key topics**: Code formatting, indentation, naming patterns, code organization

### object-patterns.md
**Purpose**: Detailed patterns and guidelines for specific AL object types
**When to use**: Creating tables, pages, codeunits, reports, or other AL objects with proper implementation patterns
**Key topics**: Table design, page layouts, codeunit structure, report patterns, object relationships

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
1. **Identify your scenario**: Determine which aspect of AL development you're working on
2. **Select appropriate guideline**: Choose the instruction file that matches your current task
3. **Apply systematically**: Follow the guidelines step-by-step for consistent results
4. **Cross-reference**: Check SharedGuidelines for naming conventions and code style standards

### Development Process Integration

### Transition Points
- **From SharedGuidelines**: Apply core principles and standards to object development
  - Review core-principles.md before starting development
  - Reference naming-conventions for consistent object naming
  - Apply code-style standards throughout implementation

- **To TestingValidation**: Move from development to quality assurance
  - Complete object implementation with proper error handling
  - Ensure naming conventions support test automation
  - Validate business logic meets requirements before testing phase

- **To PerformanceOptimization**: Optimize implemented objects for performance
  - Profile current performance baseline before optimization
  - Apply optimization patterns to existing object implementations
  - Maintain code quality while improving performance metrics

### Shared Component Usage
- **Naming Conventions**: Applied to all objects, procedures, variables, and fields
- **Code Style Standards**: Consistent formatting, indentation, and commenting patterns
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Uniform exception management across all business logic
- **Core Principles**: Architectural guidance for all development decisions

### Cross-References
- See `SharedGuidelines/Standards/` for: naming-conventions, code-style, error-handling

## Quick Reference

### Key Rules
1. **Extension Model**: Always use extension model rather than modifying base application
2. **Object Naming**: Follow meaningful naming conventions with appropriate prefixes
3. **Code Organization**: Structure code logically with proper separation of concerns

### Common Patterns
- **Table Development**: Primary keys, field design, data classification, validation
- **Page Development**: Layout before actions, proper field organization, user experience
- **Codeunit Development**: Single responsibility principle, procedure accessibility, event patterns

### Quick Checklist
- [ ] Object has meaningful, descriptive name with appropriate prefix
- [ ] Code follows established formatting and style standards
- [ ] Object implements proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Fields have appropriate tooltips and properties set
- [ ] Code is organized logically with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Extension model used instead of base application modification
