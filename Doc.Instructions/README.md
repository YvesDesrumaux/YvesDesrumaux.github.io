These are instructions to create end users documentation.

# Organize Your Content

Structure your content in a logical and hierarchical manner. Start with a clear table of contents that outlines the main sections and sub-sections. 
1. Target/Business Value as introduction
2. definition : What is the business specific glossary to be explained before using the apps.
3. Setup : How to install app, what is the steup procedure. What to setup in setup page.
4. Master Data’s: Explain master data's specific for the app. If standard master data's are extended or altered, explain specifically.
5. Business flows: Detail specific business flows. When needed emphasize when standard business flows are altered
6. Technical /advanced features (api/reports/etc..). On page to list anx explain API's. One page to list and explain sppecific apps reports.

Organizing content into categories or chapters makes it easier for users to quickly navigate and find the information they need.

# Documentation files
Make documentation in .md format.
Save files in Documentation Directory.

# Write Clear & Concise Content
- The content should be easy to understand and free of technical jargon. Use simple language, short sentences, and bullet points to break down complex ideas. 
- Remember to add visuals like screenshots, diagrams, or videos to complement the text and aid in users’ comprehension.
- Avoid long pages 

# Explain de value of the app/function
- Introduce business scenario’s to be addressed.
- What is the value for end user.
- Use Leaflet presentation to introduce application.

# We make documentation for BC users
- They are supposed to know the standard processes.
- No need to explain business central.
- Don’t explain what is obvious “Click on new….”

# Pictures 
- A picture with no data doesn’t bring any information
- Be careful: Pictures also need to be updated when a new release is shipped. Not easy to identify which picture/screen should be updated
- Too much pictures depreciates the overall structure of the documentation.
- Explain the business rules (no need to have a picture for an error message)

# This is written documentation
Make it confortable for readers.
- Use color to identify key concepts/alerts.
- Avoid oral expressions “It’s”, “They’re”, etc…
- Create rythm / catcheyes

# Explain Process with Step by Step Structure
Example : 
Steps:
1. Populate the New Block field.
2. Click Move Lines to Block.
3. The line is reassigned, and New Block is cleared.
